api_v2 is a Django app which provides the back-end storage and search capabilities 
for Indy Catalyst Credential Registry.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "api_v2" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'api_v2',
    ]

2. Include the api_v2 URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path("api/v2/", include("api_v2.urls")),

3. Move the api_v2 folder (remove from TheOrgBook repo) into this directory

4. Run "python setup.py sdist" to create a distribution

5. Include the following in your Docker build pipeline to build the OrgBook image::

    build-api() {
      #
      # tob-api
      #
      echo -e "\nBuilding indy cat api image ..."
      docker build -q \
        -t 'indycat-api-build' \
        -f '../../../../credential-registry/server/django-icat-api/Dockerfile' '../../../../credential-registry/server/django-icat-api/'
      BASE_IMAGE="indycat-api-build"
      #BASE_IMAGE="bcgovimages/von-image:py36-1.7-ew-0-s2i"
      echo -e "\nBuilding django image from ${BASE_IMAGE}..."
      ${S2I_EXE} build \
        -e "HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY}" \
        -e "HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY}" \
        -e "PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=" \
        -v "${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_tob-pip-cache:/home/indy/.cache/pip" \
        '../tob-api' \
        "$BASE_IMAGE" \
        'django'
    }

4. Follow the rest of the Indy Catalyst instructions!
