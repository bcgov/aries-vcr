# TheOrgBook

TheOrgBook is a **Credential Registry** of verifiable credentials about entities. A public instance of TheOrgBook, such as [BC's OrgBook](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca) contains a verifiable credentials about organizations (incorporations, professionals, etc.) issued by trusted public services such as Corporate Registries, regulatory agencies, permitting services, licencing services, procurement services and the like.

The Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) envisions the possibility of a number of public repositories of Verifiable Claims as a way of bootstrapping a trusted digital ecosystem.

`TheOrgBook` is being developed as part of the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON). For more information on VON see https://vonx.io.  Even, better - join in with what we are doing and contribute to VON and the Indy community.

## Quick Start Guide

The best way to get started with a new project is by working with a running instance.  The VON [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/dFlow/blob/master/docker/VONNetworkQuickStartGuide.md) will get you started with an [Indy Network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network), an instance of [TheOrgBook (this repo)](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook) and an instance of [dFlow](https://github.com/bcgov/dFlow) running on your local machine in Docker.  Give it a try!

## Running TheOrgBook on OpenShift

To deploy TheOrgBook on a local instance of OpenShift, refer to [Running TheOrgBook Locally on OpenShift](./RunningLocal.md).  These instructions, apart from the steps that are specific to setting up your local environment, can also be used to get the project deployed to a production OpenShift environment.

## Running TheOrgBook on Docker

The project can also be run locally using Docker and Docker Compose.  Refer to [Running TheOrgBook with Docker Compose](./docker/README.md) for instructions.

## Resetting the Ledger

For information on the process of resetting the ledger and wallets refer to the [Resetting the Ledger and Wallets](./ResettingTheLedger.md) documentation.
