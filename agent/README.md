# Introduction

Placeholder README for forthcoming Indy Catalyst Agent software.

# Running the software locally

The software is made available as a [Python "Egg"](https://wiki.python.org/moin/egg). Currently the best way to run the software locally is to install the egg directly using `pip`. Python3 is required.

```
pip3 install --upgrade -e .
```

```
icatagent --help
```

A docker environment for testing and local development will be available in the near future.

# Running tests

Running the test suite is pretty easy:

```
pytest
```
